/*
Implement kReverse( int k ) in a linked list i.e. you need to reverse first K elements then reverse next k elements and join the linked list and so on.
Indexing starts from 0. If less than k elements left in the last, you need to reverse them as well. If k is greater than length of LL, reverse the complete LL.
You don't need to print the elements, just return the head of updated LL.
Input format :

Line 1 : Linked list elements (separated by space and terminated by -1)

Line 2 : k

Sample Input 1 :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -1
4
Sample Output 1 :
4 3 2 1 8 7 6 5 10 9
Sample Input 2 :
1 2 3 4 5 -1
2
Sample Output 2 :
2 1 4 3 5 
Sample Input 3 :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -1
3
Sample Output 3 :
3 2 1 6 5 4 7
